# Terpene-Parser-Testing
_just for testing purposes_

## FAQ for nosy people
Q: What do you test here exactly?

A: Well, GitHub allows you to only host one site per repository.
For the terpene parser project we sometimes need to test things live.
And sometimes we need opinions for decision making from other team members.
So this is the easiest way to do this.


Q: So I can totally spy on you and see what you are doing! Muhahaha!

A: Yes. But I don't care. Remember, the actual project is completely open source
and I would share all development files, but I don't think it makes sense.
You can actually use this repository's site to take a sneak peek on what's to come ;)
